    <div class="mainBlockOfKrusty">

        <h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Krusty_the_Clown" target="_blank">Krusty the Clown</a></h2>

        <img src="images/img.png" alt="Krusty the Clown">

        <p>

            Krusty has Jewish parents and lived with his father in the Jewish community. As a rabbi, his father heavily
            criticized his son's career choice as a comedian. Keeping his entertainment lifestyle a secret, Krusty
            continued his
            role as a comedian until the day when his father came to one of his shows and a rowdy rabbi sprayed the
            makeup off
            his face. After this event, his father stopped talking to him, and they didn't make contact until many years
            later
            with Bart and Lisa Simpson. Although ethnically Jewish, he generally doesn't want to stress this heritage,
            to the
            extent that he prohibits any references to his Jewish background on his show.

            Krusty, without his makeup, bears an uncanny physical resemblance to Homer Simpson. However, there are also
            differences such as his cow-skull birthmark and small feet. Krusty, like Homer, has apparently faced heart
            problems
            in the past as he currently has a pacemaker, which has since permanently made his face white.

            He also seems to be disturbed at even the mere mention of someone having an affair, as when Homer tells
            Krusty the
            Clown that Apu was cheating on Manjula (due to his thinking he would joke about it), he reacted quite
            differently
            from how Homer expected by saying in a remorseful tone that it was sad and feeling sorry for all of their
            kids.
            Krusty lives in his mansion in the upscale residential area of Springfield Heights, which is also home to
            mob don
            Fat Tony and actor Troy McClure.

    <div class="mainBlockOfMilhouse">

        <h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten" target="_blank">Milhouse Van Houten</a></h2>

        <img src="images/img_1.png" alt="Milhouse Van Houten">


        <p>

            This is a ten year old boy and Bart Simpson's best friend. As the only child of Kirk and Luann Van Houten,
            Milhouse's most distinctive physical traits are his blue hair, big nose and extreme nearsightedness
            (depicted by
            very small eyes), requiring thick glasses to correct. He has regular intelligence but somewhat poor social
            skills.
            Although devious in his own way, Milhouse is quite gullible, which is why he is often led into trouble by
            Bart, who
            is not shy about taking advantage of the other's naïveté. Milhouse serves as the school president of the
            Springfield
            Elementary from 2004 to 2005.

    <div class="mainBlockOfJaney">

        <h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Janey_Powell" target="_blank">Janey Powell</a></h2>

        <img src="images/img_2.png" alt="Janey Powell">

        <p>

            Janey is noted as "Lisa's fair-weather best friend", and this is an accurate description. Though she is
            often seen
            hanging out with Lisa, at other times she teases her along with the other children for her misfortunes or
            idealistic
            views. (For example, when Lisa first decides to go vegetarian, Janey is one of the first to mock her for it,
            asking
            whether Lisa was planning to marry a carrot.) She is not nearly as intelligent or nerdy as Lisa, once
            blowing a
            bubble with chewing gum rather than engage in Lisa's current conversation.

            She has spent the night at the Simpsons's house, and Lisa is seen watching cartoons at her house on numerous
            occasions. She is also seen reading "The Babysitter Twins" with Lisa. Janey is also seen to be concerned for
            Lisa's
            well being, one is evident in Separate Vocations, when a depressed and sulky Lisa attempts to enter the
            girls's
            bathroom inhibited by rebellious fifth grade girls. She tries to warn Lisa in vain not to enter it, only for
            her to
            ignore Janey and enter the bathroom anyway.

            Janey may have had a crush on Milhouse Van Houten, who has a crush on Lisa. In The Simpsons Game, she asks
            Bart
            where Milhouse is and calls Lisa cruel for leading Milhouse on. She sells cupcakes in school. She also said
            that
            Milhouse doesn't like Lisa when other students were mocking them about it, which made the students mock her
            for
            liking Milhouse instead.

            According to The Lisa Book, Janey is considered to be one of the most popular girls in second grade, in a
            poll that
            she conducted herself. She is very fashion-conscious, being particularly wary of clothes that look Canadian.
            She
            also enjoys the company of other girls, especially when they fawn on her. From Janey's perspective, either
            you're
            with her or you have "cooties".

        <h2><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Charles_Montgomery_Burns" target="_blank">Charles Montgomery
            Burns</a></h2>

        <img src="images/img_3.png" alt="Charles Montgomery Burns">

        <p>

            Charles Montgomery Plantagenet Schicklgruber Burns, also known as Monty Burns, Montgomery Burns, C.M. Burns,
            and Mr.
            Burns, is the owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and the main antagonist of The Simpsons
            franchise. He is
            Springfield's richest, oldest, and most powerful citizen. His net worth has been stated to be in the
            billions and in
            one instance was pegged at exactly $1,800,037,022.

            He had, on three occasions, lost his entire fortune, and at another time slipped to "only" $996 million
            ($996,036,000), leading to his expulsion from Billionaire Camp. Despite his proficiency with firearms, Burns
            is very
            elderly and physically frail but employs relentless and ruthless tactics to get whatever he wants.

            In "Undercover Burns", after a "put your child to work day" at the Nuclear Plant he becomes aware his
            employees hate
            him and disguises himself as Fred Kranepool (via a specially made suit and voice change chip) to find out
            why.
            Homer, Carl and Lenny were upset after learning their new friend "Fred" was really Mr. Burns.

            In "Burger Kings", Burns becomes a burger fan and starts a meat - free burger restaurant called X-cell-ent
            Burger to
            become a beloved figure. However, this fails because the vegan burgers are made from endangered plants from
            the
            Amazon Rainforest.
